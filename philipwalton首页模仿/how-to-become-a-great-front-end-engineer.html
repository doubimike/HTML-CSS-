				<h1 class="article-title">How to Become a Great Front-End Engineer</h1>

				<p>I recently received an email from a reader of my blog that, for whatever reason, really got me thinking. Here’s what it said:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Hi Philip, is it okay to ask how you become a great front-end engineer?<br>
					Any advice?</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I have to admit, I was surprised to even be asked this question since I’ve never really thought of myself as a “great” front-end engineer. In fact, the first few years I worked in this industry, I honestly don’t think I was qualified for any of the jobs I had. I only applied for them because I didn’t realize how little I knew, and I only got them because the people interviewing me didn’t know what questions to ask.</p>
				<p>That being said, I ended up doing very well in each of these roles and became a valued member of the team. When I eventually left (for the next challenge I was also not qualified for) I was usually tasked with hiring my replacement. Looking back now on how I approached these interviews, I’m struck by how much emphasis I placed on knowledge—despite lacking in that area when I started. My current self probably wouldn’t have hired my former self, even though I knew from personal experience that success was possible.</p>
				<p>The longer I work on the web, the more I realize that what separates the good people from the really good people isn’t what they know; it’s how they think. Obviously knowledge is important—critical in some cases—but in a field that changes so quickly, how you go about acquiring that knowledge is always going to be more important (at least in the long term) than what you know at any given time. And perhaps most important of all: how you use that knowledge to solve everyday problems.</p>
				<p>There are plenty of articles out there that talk about the languages, frameworks, and tools you need to know to get a job. I wanted to take a different approach. In this article I’m going to talk about the mindset of a front-end engineer, and hopefully give a more lasting answer to the question: <em>how do you become great?</em></p>

				<p>One of the main differences between front and back-end code is back-end code generally runs in an environment that’s under your control. The front end, by contrast, is completely outside of your control. The platform or device your users have could completely change at any moment, and your code needs to be able to handle that gracefully.</p>
